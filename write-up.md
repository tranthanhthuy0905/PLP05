# WRITE-UP
1. Does your language support objects or something similar (e.g., structs or records)?
<br>
C++ accepts records and structs. A record, commonly called a structure in C++, is a collection of related data items.
<br>
2. Are there naming conventions for objects, instance variables, or functions that people writing in your language should be aware of?
<br>
Object in C++ must be named with capitalization while instance variables only accepts the 
lower-case letter at the beginning. Both only accept [A-Za-z_] after the first letter. Similar
to functions
<br>
3. Does your language have standard methods for functions that serve a similar purpose across all objects? For example, toString() in Java and __str__ in Python allow information about the objects to be printed. Are there similar functions in your language?
<br>
C++ does not have toString() or __str__ similar to Java and Python but to override the stream operator << for stream in toString() method. Most functions/objects in C++ are user-defined ones.
<br>
4. How does inheritance work (if it does)? Does your language support multiple inheritance?
<br>
C++ accepts multiple inheritance. Inheritance has higher power than access specifiers.
<br>
5. If there is inheritance, how does your language deal with overloading method names and resolving those calls?
6. Is there anything else thatâ€™s important to know about objects and inheritance in your language?
