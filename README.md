Assignment 4: Loops and functions

 

Due: April 25, 2022

 

While some languages like Python and Java are “object-oriented”, not all languages are. Some can contain objects or object-like constructions, while others can’t do anything like that. Of the languages that do support objects, there are many different ways of implementing inheritance.

In your programming language, do the following (or explain why it can’t be done as described):

 

- Create an object (a simple Person or Date object is fine)
- Give the object class attributes (aka instance variables)
- Give the object functions
- Create an object that inherits from the first object (e.g., Student or Appointment) with some attributes and functions of its own
- Test how to instantiate both types of objects, call their functions, and modify their variables.
 

For your write-up, address the following items:

1. Does your language support objects or something similar (e.g., structs or records)?
2. Are there naming conventions for objects, instance variables, or functions that people writing in your language should be aware of?
3. Does your language have standard methods for functions that serve a similar purpose across all objects? For example, toString() in Java and __str__ in Python allow information about the objects to be printed. Are there similar functions in your language?
4. How does inheritance work (if it does)? Does your language support multiple inheritance?
5. If there is inheritance, how does your language deal with overloading method names and resolving those calls?
6. Is there anything else that’s important to know about objects and inheritance in your language?
I know this question is vague, but objects are were languages can vary a lot, so it’s hard to ask questions that will apply to everyone.
 

If your language doesn't support anything like this, then explain why not and what it does instead, or how people work around not having those things.

 

As always, write out the answers to these questions as though you were writing a guide for a new learner.  Make your answers as clear as possible, and don't just answer the questions in one or two words.  Explain the reasoning behind the answers as much as possible.  If there is no clear-cut answer to a question, explain why not.  And cite your sources! 

 

Post both your example code and your written answers.
